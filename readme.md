[Qt](https://www.qt.io/) framework based chat

## Running the app

```bash
# Open the project in the Qt Creator
# To test, you will need to run two windows: one for the server and one for the client. To prevent a previously opened window from closing when building the project, go to Edit -> Preferences -> Build & Run -> General -> Stop applications before building -> None
# After this, you can start and use it
```
